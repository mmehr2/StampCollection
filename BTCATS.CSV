"(X)Austria Judaica Tabs",-2,,68,"In
 1980 the Austrian Jewish Community, wanting to honour Theodore
 Herzl’s 120th Birthday, approached the Austrian Post Office
 and requested them to issue a stamp for this occasion. Realizing
 the international repercussions this would have in many Third World
 as well as Arab countries not favourably disposed towards Israel,
 the Post Office declined. Instead they suggested that a brief message
 be printed commemorating the event on the bottom row of 10 tabs
 adjoining most Austrian definitives. THE AUSTRIAN JUDAICA
 TAB SETS WERE BORN! 
 The first set featuring the first JNF stamp on the tab
 was immediately sold out. Subsequent sets were just as popular
 and many sets or single stamps were sold out within weeks of the
 day of issue. Distribution of the stamps was given exclusively
 to the “Friends
 of the Israel Philatelic Community” in Austria. Most issues were
 produced in quantities ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 sets. Some were
 produced in the low hundreds! From the onset, JUDAICA SALES has
 been fortunate in being able to acquire sufficient sets for all its
 customers. However, some sets and First Day Covers are now COMPLETELY
 SOLD OUT, and others are available in very limited quantities. Prices
 have remained reasonable for most issues. All sets issued to date are
 listed, including those NOT AVAILABLE (N/A). Items noted (---)
 in price column indicate item was never available. 
 A few sets
 and First Day Covers as well as special covers are available in
 some quantities.THESE ITEMS HAVE BEEN REDUCED A FULL 50% IN PRICE
 FROM PREVIOUS LISTS AND ARE BOLDLY HI-LITED IN ITALICS!! There
 is no better time than the present to complete your Austrian Judaica
 tab collection, or start one now. Please understand, however, that
 we cannot guarantee under any circumstances completion of your collection. We have re-numbered our Austrian Judaica Tabs to reflect the different
 number of issues and re-issues of various sets or singles to date.
 This allows you to determine which items are missing in your collection.
 All issues are listed including those not in stock. They are listed
 in chronological order, but due to a numbering error, two issues
 #AUI053 and 054 are listed out of place. Numbers followed by a dot
