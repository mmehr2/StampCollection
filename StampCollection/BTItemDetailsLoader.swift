import Foundation
import GameKit // for random functions

// class that is responsible for loading item details to go with BTDealerItems in category 2 (Sets)
// these are done by running a dedicated BTMessageDelegate for each item
// Usage Scenario:
//   Caller creates loader, specifying a completion handler to run at the end.
//   Caller can also specify a delegate to receive the detail items.
//   Optionally, the caller can adjust the batch size and frequency (time in secs between batches)
//
//   Caller adds items one by one as the dealer items are downloaded (assumed category 2 Sets)
//      This is done using the addItem() function, passing the href of the pic page URL
//
//   Once all items have been loaded, the caller calls run() to start batch sending of web requests.
//   This will call runInfo() in batches on all items until all have been processed.
//
//   At the end, when no more items are left, the completion handler is run on the main queue
//   At any given time, the progress.totalUnitCount tells how many items are being processed,
//      and progress.completedUnitCount will return how many have been done so far.
//   The property count will specify how many are left to receive results for.

// Architecture Update:
/*
 To reduce memory footprint and allow the function to work on small-memory devices, we need to think about having 1100+ objects.
 After some thought, it seems best to do the following:
 1. Modify the setup to create a pool of batchSize handlers (BTMessageDelegate) that point to this for info message replies
 2. Configure these objects for BTItemDetails usage (MUST BE DONE ON MAIN THREAD)
 3. Redo items and batch to be Set<String> or Set<Int> (id code or just the numeric part)
 4. At addItem() time, save only the number or code
 5. At runtime, for each individual number, reconstruct the href, rewrite the url, and invoke runInfo()
 6. *** I believe this will also require a mod to the handler (add an ID number) so that routing works downstream.
 
 To address the final point, the BTDealerStore has used the identity of the (up until now) unique handler to key its lookup for the intended destination object (BTDealerItem) for the detail response to attach to.
 Now that the handler objects will be no longer unique, we need to provide a way to find the BTDealerItem.
 After trying several ideas, I believe the solution is to provide the ability to look up the BTDealerItem objects by code in the category object they are associated with (and downloaded using). This turns out to require a lot less code than I thought, and also will preclude the need to do any kind of routing. If the code can be reconstructed from the handler URL, then the item can be retrieved. This is easily done since the code is used directly in the URL href (last component after the '=' in the pic.php URL.
 */

/*
 DEMO MODE -
 The loader operation can be tested by setting the demo flag to true before calling run().
 A demo run will call all the logic except the async code dispatch to actually load the items.
 Console printouts will indicate the order of handler assignment, object running, and whether or not the completion is called.
 */

/*
 INTENT TO RANDOMIZE
 Once I am confident that the scheme will work, I intend to randomly perturb both the batchSize (up to the poolSize) and the inter-batch delay factor to avoid deluging the internet with traffic and/or triggering anti-spam blocking behavior on the site. Perhaps this is also needed in the item download, will consider adapting this scheme later for category item use.

/*
 Design Update (not Architecture):
 The entire design of the BTMessageDelegate subsystem has been called into question and found wanting.
 Using hidden WKWebViews with script injection, a novel technique I designed, is not considered standard practice. Specifically, it seems it cannot be used to fully automate updates from a background task as I have attempted to do here. It is a much better design to download the webpage text as a normal data task in a URLSession, and then parse it with a library such as SwiftSoup that can parse HTML into a parse tree like what Javascript would do to create the DOM.
 I can redesign the details loader to use this method more simply because it uses minimal Javascript and simple parsing on the body text. It currently finds line 4 of the body text. I can possibly even put something together without using the library (and CocoaPods) at all.
 Later on, I can work this library into the BTMessageDelegate class, replacing the three JS files and message generation design with a Swift-based parsing module that can use a delegate setup to retain much of its existing design. Then I can fully background-automate the ReloadAll function of the BT (and JS) categories VC. This may take some time to get right, and I need to figure out the best testing for it (will using Update with no changes triggered be sufficient proof?).
 
 UPDATE:
 I will use the BTMessageDelegate as a holder for the URL, not actively use it to load the URL. This will allow the dealer store to extract the code from the URL and route the BTItemDetails to the proper BTDealerItem. I could change the BTInfoProtocol instead, and may do so after converting the entire download process, but for now, this is sufficient.
 I use an internal (ephemeral) URLSession to dispatch URLSessionDataTasks. I chose ephemeral because the extra features are probably not needed in the default session, but if I am mistaken, a .default configuration should be fine. Eventually, we will want .background to be used for the dealer store's overall download task (ReloadAll).
 To keep the data tasks from being deleted during processing, their references are kept in an internal table indexed by code number. When the completion handler is run, it will remove the internal reference and release the object memory.
 The task completion handler (since we are not using any delegates) must deal with parsing the data, which comes in as raw HTML. For purposes of this project, the fixed format HTML has title and detail lines in known locations in the lines array (lines 32 and 38), and as long as BT doesn't change this format, we can parse the info we need by stripping HTML tags from the returned text. When we have a full HTML parsing library on board, this can be replaced to get the proper structure (which also is at the BT site's whim to change if they have a need).
 Once the data is parsed and a BTItemDetails object is created, we can simulate the receipt of the BTMessageDelegate's BTInfoProtocol message, which will send the item and its chosen BTMD handler to the recipient (dealer store).
 
 TBD - we can stop the page loading (for now) once 38 lines have been received. This will require use of the delegates to the data task, but may significantly shorten the time needed overall, especially when having to download the images, and the long text of the leaflet that is included after the summary line we want.
