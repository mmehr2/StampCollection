import GameKit // for random functions

// class that is responsible for loading item details to go with BTDealerItems in category 2 (Sets)
// these are done by running a dedicated BTMessageDelegate for each item
// Usage Scenario:
//   Caller creates loader, specifying a completion handler to run at the end.
//   Caller can also specify a delegate to receive the detail items.
//   Optionally, the caller can adjust the batch size and frequency (time in secs between batches)
//
//   Caller adds items one by one as the dealer items are downloaded (assumed category 2 Sets)
//      This is done using the addItem() function, passing the href of the pic page URL
//
//   Once all items have been loaded, the caller calls run() to start batch sending of web requests.
//   This will call runInfo() in batches on all items until all have been processed.
//
//   At the end, when no more items are left, the completion handler is run on the main queue
//   At any given time, the progress.totalUnitCount tells how many items are being processed,
//      and progress.completedUnitCount will return how many have been done so far.
//   The property count will specify how many are left to receive results for.
//
// Architecture Update:
/*
 To reduce memory footprint and allow the function to work on small-memory devices, we need to think about having 1100+ objects.
 After some thought, it seems best to do the following:
 1. Modify the setup to create a pool of batchSize handlers (BTMessageDelegate) that point to this for info message replies
 2. Configure these objects for BTItemDetails usage (MUST BE DONE ON MAIN THREAD)
 3. Redo items and batch to be Set<String> or Set<Int> (id code or just the numeric part)
 4. At addItem() time, save only the number or code
 5. At runtime, for each individual number, reconstruct the href, rewrite the url, and invoke runInfo()
 6. *** I believe this will also require a mod to the handler (add an ID number) so that routing works downstream.
 
 To address the final point, the BTDealerStore has used the identity of the (up until now) unique handler to key its lookup for the intended destination object (BTDealerItem) for the detail response to attach to.
 Now that the handler objects will be no longer unique, we need to provide a way to find the BTDealerItem.
 After trying several ideas, I believe the solution is to provide the ability to look up the BTDealerItem objects by code in the category object they are associated with (and downloaded using). This turns out to require a lot less code than I thought, and also will preclude the need to do any kind of routing. If the code can be reconstructed from the handler URL, then the item can be retrieved. This is easily done since the code is used directly in the URL href (last component after the '=' in the pic.php URL.

/*
 DEMO MODE -
 The loader operation can be tested by setting the demo flag to true before calling run().
 A demo run will call all the logic except the async code dispatch to actually load the items.
 Console printouts will indicate the order of handler assignment, object running, and whether or not the completion is called.
 */

/*
 INTENT TO RANDOMIZE
 Once I am confident that the scheme will work, I intend to randomly perturb both the batchSize (up to the poolSize) and the inter-batch delay factor to avoid deluging the internet with traffic and/or triggering anti-spam blocking behavior on the site. Perhaps this is also needed in the item download, will consider adapting this scheme later for category item use.
